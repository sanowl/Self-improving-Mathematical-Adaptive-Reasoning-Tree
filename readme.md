## Overview

ARTEMIS represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, addressing fundamental challenges that have plagued existing systems:

### The Mathematical Reasoning Challenge

Mathematical problem-solving requires a unique combination of:
- **Logical deduction**: Following rigorous logical steps
- **Strategic thinking**: Choosing which approach to take among many possibilities
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying familiar structures and applying known techniques
- **Creative insight**: Sometimes requiring novel combinations of existing methods
- **Error recovery**: Recognizing dead ends and finding alternative paths

Traditional approaches to automated mathematical reasoning have struggled with several critical issues:

1. **Combinatorial Explosion**: The space of possible reasoning steps grows exponentially
2. **Heuristic Brittleness**: Hand-coded evaluation functions fail on novel problems
3. **Lack of Backtracking**: Systems get stuck in unproductive reasoning paths
4. **Poor State Representation**: Mathematical context is lost in pure text processing
5. **No Learning from Experience**: Systems don't improve from solving similar problems

### SMART-CoT Solution

SMART-CoT tackles these challenges through a sophisticated integration of:

- **Reinforcement Learning**: The system learns to evaluate reasoning states and select promising directions
- **Adaptive Pruning**: Dynamically adjusts search parameters based on problem complexity
- **Structured Mathematical Representation**: Maintains explicit mathematical state with equations, variables, and constraints
- **Intelligent Backtracking**: Recognizes failure patterns and returns to promising alternative paths
- **Multi-Faceted Evaluation**: Scores reasoning steps on feasibility, novelty, progress, and mathematical validity

## Mathematical Foundations

### Problem Formalization

In SMART-CoT, a mathematical reasoning problem is formalized as a tuple:

```
P = (S‚ÇÄ, G, T, R)
```

Where:
- **S‚ÇÄ**: Initial state containing the problem statement and extracted mathematical structures
- **G**: Goal condition (typically finding values for unknown variables)
- **T**: Set of available reasoning techniques (algebraic manipulation, substitution, etc.)
- **R**: Reward function that evaluates solution quality

### State Space Representation

Each reasoning state `s ‚àà S` is represented as:

```
s = (C, M, h, œÄ)
```

Where:
- **C**: Textual content of the reasoning chain
- **M**: Mathematical state containing:
  - `E = {e‚ÇÅ, e‚ÇÇ, ..., e‚Çô}`: Set of equations
  - `V = {v‚ÇÅ ‚Üí val‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ ‚Üí val‚ÇÇ, ...}`: Variable assignments
  - `K`: Set of constraints and assumptions
  - `T_applied`: Applied reasoning techniques
- **h**: Heuristic features extracted from the state
- **œÄ**: Progress indicators toward the goal

### Reasoning Techniques

ARTEMIS employs several categories of mathematical reasoning techniques:

#### 1. Algebraic Manipulation
Fundamental operations that preserve equation equality:

- **Addition/Subtraction**: For equation `a = b`, derive `a ¬± c = b ¬± c`
- **Multiplication/Division**: For equation `a = b` and `c ‚â† 0`, derive `ac = bc` or `a/c = b/c`
- **Factoring**: Transform `ax + bx = c` to `x(a + b) = c`
- **Expansion**: Transform `a(b + c) = d` to `ab + ac = d`

#### 2. Substitution Methods
- **Direct substitution**: Replace variables with known values
- **Expression substitution**: Replace sub-expressions with equivalent forms
- **System solving**: Use one equation to eliminate variables in others

#### 3. Simplification Strategies
- **Like term combination**: Merge similar algebraic terms
- **Rational simplification**: Reduce fractions to lowest terms
- **Trigonometric identities**: Apply standard trigonometric relationships
- **Logarithmic properties**: Utilize logarithm rules for simplification

### Reinforcement Learning Framework

SMART-CoT uses a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP) for mathematical reasoning:

#### State Space
The state space `S` consists of all possible reasoning states reachable from the initial problem statement.

#### Action Space  
Actions `A(s)` available in state `s` include:
- Applying a specific reasoning technique to an equation
- Introducing a new variable or constraint
- Backtracking to a previous state
- Declaring a solution found

#### Transition Function
The transition function `T(s, a, s')` represents the probability of reaching state `s'` from state `s` via action `a`. This is deterministic in ARTEMIS since mathematical operations have definite outcomes.

#### Reward Function
The reward function `R(s, a, s')` provides feedback:

```
R(s, a, s') = w‚ÇÅ¬∑R_progress(s') + w‚ÇÇ¬∑R_validity(s') + w‚ÇÉ¬∑R_efficiency(s, s') + w‚ÇÑ¬∑R_novelty(s')
```

Where:
- **R_progress**: Measures advancement toward solving the problem
- **R_validity**: Ensures mathematical correctness
- **R_efficiency**: Rewards shorter solution paths
- **R_novelty**: Encourages exploration of new reasoning strategies

#### Value Function
The state value function `V(s)` estimates the expected cumulative reward from state `s`:

```
V(s) = E[‚àë_{t=0}^‚àû Œ≥·µó R(s‚Çú, a‚Çì, s‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ) | s‚ÇÄ = s]
```

This is approximated using a neural network that takes the state feature vector as input.

### Mathematical Convergence Theory

#### Theoretical Guarantees

SMART-CoT's convergence properties are grounded in several mathematical frameworks:

**Theorem 1 (Value Function Convergence)**: Under the conditions that:
- The mathematical reasoning space is finite and acyclic
- The reward function R is bounded: |R(s,a,s')| ‚â§ R_max
- The learning rate satisfies the Robbins-Monro conditions: ‚àëŒ±‚Çú = ‚àû, ‚àëŒ±‚Çú¬≤ < ‚àû

Then the value function V_Œ∏(s) converges almost surely to the optimal value function V*(s).

**Proof Sketch**: The mathematical reasoning process can be modeled as a finite MDP where each state represents a partial solution. Since mathematical operations are deterministic and the problem space is bounded by the initial conditions, the state space is finite. The proof follows from standard Q-learning convergence results under the Robbins-Monro conditions.

**Theorem 2 (Search Complexity Bounds)**: For a mathematical problem with solution depth d and branching factor b, SMART-CoT achieves:
- **Best Case**: O(d) when the value function perfectly guides search
- **Average Case**: O(b^(d/2)) with learned pruning reducing effective branching
- **Worst Case**: O(b^d) equivalent to exhaustive search

#### Adaptive Pruning Mathematics

The adaptive pruning mechanism is governed by the following mathematical formulation:

**Pruning Function**: Let P(s, k) be the probability that state s leads to a solution within k steps. The adaptive pruning threshold œÑ(t) at time t is:

œÑ(t) = œÑ‚ÇÄ ¬∑ exp(-Œªt) + (1 - exp(-Œªt)) ¬∑ œÑ_adaptive(t)

where:
- œÑ‚ÇÄ: Initial conservative threshold
- Œª: Adaptation rate parameter  
- œÑ_adaptive(t): Learned threshold based on problem complexity

**Complexity Estimation**: Problem complexity C(P) is estimated using:

C(P) = w‚ÇÅ¬∑|V(P)| + w‚ÇÇ¬∑|E(P)| + w‚ÇÉ¬∑D(P) + w‚ÇÑ¬∑N(P)

where:
- |V(P)|: Number of variables in problem P
- |E(P)|: Number of equations/constraints
- D(P): Maximum degree of polynomial expressions
- N(P): Depth of nested expressions

#### Multi-Objective Optimization Framework

SMART-CoT employs a multi-objective optimization approach where the scoring function combines multiple mathematical objectives:

**Pareto Optimality**: A reasoning state s is Pareto optimal if there exists no other state s' such that:
- f_i(s') ‚â• f_i(s) for all objectives i ‚àà {feasibility, novelty, progress, validity}
- f_j(s') > f_j(s) for at least one objective j

**Scalarization**: The multi-objective problem is converted to scalar optimization using:

F(s) = ‚àë·µ¢ w·µ¢ ¬∑ f·µ¢(s) + Œº ¬∑ ‚àë·µ¢<j |w·µ¢f·µ¢(s) - w‚±ºf‚±º(s)|

The second term penalizes imbalanced objective values, encouraging well-rounded reasoning states.

### Information-Theoretic Analysis

#### Entropy in Mathematical Reasoning

The entropy of a reasoning state measures the uncertainty in potential solution paths:

H(S) = -‚àë‚Çõ P(s|evidence) log P(s|evidence)

**Entropy Reduction**: Each reasoning step should ideally reduce entropy:

ŒîH = H(S_before) - H(S_after) > 0

**Information Gain**: The information gain from applying reasoning technique T is:

IG(T) = H(S) - ‚àë‚Çõ' P(s'|s,T) ¬∑ H(S'|s')

#### Mathematical Knowledge Representation

SMART-CoT represents mathematical knowledge using a hierarchical probabilistic model:

**Concept Hierarchy**: Mathematical concepts form a directed acyclic graph where:
- Nodes represent mathematical concepts (variables, operations, theorems)
- Edges represent dependency relationships
- Weights represent relevance to current problem context

**Bayesian Knowledge Update**: Prior knowledge P(concept) is updated with evidence:

P(concept|evidence) = P(evidence|concept) ¬∑ P(concept) / P(evidence)

### Algebraic Structure Theory

#### Reasoning Step Algebra

Mathematical reasoning steps form an algebraic structure with the following properties:

**Composition**: Two reasoning steps r‚ÇÅ and r‚ÇÇ can be composed: r‚ÇÉ = r‚ÇÅ ‚àò r‚ÇÇ

**Identity**: The identity reasoning step e leaves equations unchanged: e ‚àò r = r ‚àò e = r

**Inverse**: For reversible steps, there exists r‚Åª¬π such that r ‚àò r‚Åª¬π = e

**Associativity**: (r‚ÇÅ ‚àò r‚ÇÇ) ‚àò r‚ÇÉ = r‚ÇÅ ‚àò (r‚ÇÇ ‚àò r‚ÇÉ)

This algebraic structure allows SMART-CoT to:
- Compose complex reasoning strategies from simpler steps
- Identify when steps can be undone (backtracking)
- Optimize step sequences for minimal complexity

#### Equivalence Classes

Mathematical expressions can be grouped into equivalence classes under algebraic operations:

[expr] = {e ‚àà Expressions | e ‚â° expr under algebraic equivalence}

SMART-CoT uses these equivalence classes to:
- Avoid redundant reasoning paths
- Identify when different approaches lead to the same result
- Optimize search by representative selection

### Probability Theory in Reasoning

#### Stochastic Reasoning Models

SMART-CoT models reasoning uncertainty using probability distributions:

**Step Success Probability**: P(success|step, context) models the likelihood that applying a reasoning step in a given context leads to progress.

**Path Probability**: For a reasoning path œÄ = (s‚ÇÄ, s‚ÇÅ, ..., s‚Çô), the path probability is:

P(œÄ) = ‚àè·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÄ‚Åø‚Åª¬π P(s·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ|s·µ¢, a·µ¢)

**Expected Solution Time**: The expected time to solution follows a geometric distribution:

E[T] = 1/p where p is the probability of finding a solution at each step

#### Uncertainty Quantification

SMART-CoT quantifies uncertainty in its reasoning through:

**Epistemic Uncertainty**: Uncertainty in the model parameters Œ∏
**Aleatoric Uncertainty**: Inherent randomness in the reasoning process

Total uncertainty: Var[y] = E[Var[y|Œ∏]] + Var[E[y|Œ∏]]

### Game-Theoretic Perspective

#### Reasoning as a Game

Mathematical reasoning can be viewed as a game between:
- **Player 1**: The reasoning system (SMART-CoT)
- **Player 2**: The mathematical problem (adversarial)

**Payoff Matrix**: The payoff for choosing reasoning strategy i against problem type j is R(i,j)

**Nash Equilibrium**: SMART-CoT seeks mixed strategies that form Nash equilibria, ensuring robust performance across problem types.

**Minimax Strategy**: In the worst case, SMART-CoT employs minimax reasoning:

max_strategy min_problem R(strategy, problem)

### Complexity Analysis

#### Computational Complexity

**Time Complexity**: 
- Best case: O(d) for linear solution paths
- Average case: O(b^(d/k)) where k is the pruning effectiveness factor
- Worst case: O(b^d) for exhaustive search

**Space Complexity**: 
- Memory usage: O(b¬∑k) for beam search with width k
- Experience buffer: O(n) for n stored experiences

#### Sample Complexity

**PAC Learning Framework**: SMART-CoT learns reasoning policies with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees.

For accuracy Œµ and confidence Œ¥, the sample complexity is:

m ‚â• (1/Œµ¬≤) ¬∑ (ln|H| + ln(1/Œ¥))

where |H| is the hypothesis space size.

### Advanced Mathematical Techniques

#### Differential Geometry in Solution Space

The solution space can be viewed as a manifold where:
- Points represent mathematical states
- Geodesics represent optimal reasoning paths
- Curvature indicates problem difficulty

**Riemannian Distance**: The distance between states s‚ÇÅ and s‚ÇÇ on the solution manifold:

d(s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ) = ‚à´‚ÇÄ¬π ‚àö‚ü®Œ≥'(t), Œ≥'(t)‚ü©_g dt

where Œ≥(t) is the geodesic connecting s‚ÇÅ and s‚ÇÇ, and g is the Riemannian metric.

#### Topology of Reasoning Spaces

**Fundamental Groups**: The fundamental group œÄ‚ÇÅ(S) of the solution space S captures information about non-contractible reasoning cycles.

**Homology Groups**: H_n(S) describe n-dimensional holes in the reasoning space, indicating potential dead ends or unreachable regions.

#### Category Theory Framework

Mathematical reasoning can be formalized using category theory:

**Objects**: Mathematical expressions and equations
**Morphisms**: Reasoning steps that transform one expression to another
**Functors**: Maps between different mathematical domains (algebra ‚Üí geometry)
**Natural Transformations**: Systematic ways to transform reasoning strategies

### Statistical Learning Theory

#### Generalization Bounds

SMART-CoT's generalization performance is bounded by:

**Rademacher Complexity**: For hypothesis class H and sample size m:

R_m(H) = E[sup_{h‚ààH} (1/m) ‚àë·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ·µê œÉ·µ¢h(x·µ¢)]

where œÉ·µ¢ are Rademacher variables.

**Generalization Error**: With probability 1-Œ¥:

R(h) ‚â§ RÃÇ(h) + 2R_m(H) + ‚àö(ln(1/Œ¥)/(2m))

#### Bias-Variance Decomposition

The prediction error decomposes as:

E[(f(x) - ƒ•(x))¬≤] = Bias¬≤[ƒ•(x)] + Var[ƒ•(x)] + œÉ¬≤

SMART-CoT balances this tradeoff through:
- **Bias reduction**: Complex neural networks capture intricate reasoning patterns
- **Variance reduction**: Experience replay and regularization techniques

### Neural Network Architecture

#### Value Network
The value network `V_Œ∏(s)` is a deep neural network that maps state features to value estimates:

```
Input: h(s) ‚àà ‚Ñù·µà (state feature vector)
Hidden Layers: ReLU activations with dropout
Output: [V(s), Confidence(s)] ‚àà ‚Ñù¬≤
```

The network architecture:
```
h(s) ‚Üí Linear(d, 128) ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí Dropout(0.2) ‚Üí
       Linear(128, 64) ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí Dropout(0.2) ‚Üí
       Linear(64, 32) ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí Linear(32, 2)
```

#### Feature Extraction
State features `h(s)` combine:
- **Textual features**: Length, mathematical content density, reasoning word frequency
- **Mathematical features**: Number of equations, variables, applied techniques
- **Progress features**: Goal proximity, variable reduction, equation complexity

### Search Algorithm

SMART-CoT uses an adaptive beam search with intelligent pruning:

```

   b. If is_solution(s): Record solution, continue
   c. If should_backtrack(): Find backtrack point, restart
   d. Generate n candidate continuations from s
   e. Score all candidates using V_Œ∏
   f. Select top k survivors

- Problem complexity indicators
- Current search progress
- Historical success patterns
- Resource constraints

**Algorithm**:
```python
def adaptive_pruning(problem_state, candidate_states):
    complexity = estimate_problem_complexity(problem_state)
    progress = measure_search_progress(candidate_states)
    
    # Adapt beam width based on complexity
    n_candidates = base_width * complexity_multiplier(complexity)
    
    # Adapt survival rate based on progress
    k_survivors = max(min_survivors, 
                     n_candidates * progress_dependent_rate(progress))
    
    return n_candidates, k_survivors
```

## Mathematical Logic and Proof Theory

### Formal Logic Foundation

SMART-CoT operates within a formal logical framework that encompasses:

#### Propositional Logic
Mathematical statements are represented as logical propositions where:
- **Atomic propositions**: Basic mathematical facts (e.g., "x = 5")
- **Logical connectives**: ‚àß (and), ‚à® (or), ¬¨ (not), ‚Üí (implies), ‚Üî (if and only if)
- **Compound propositions**: Complex mathematical statements built from atomic propositions

**Semantic Interpretation**: Each proposition P is assigned a truth value T(P) ‚àà {true, false} based on the current mathematical context.

#### Predicate Logic
Extends propositional logic with:
- **Predicates**: P(x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô) expressing relationships between mathematical objects
- **Quantifiers**: ‚àÄ (for all) and ‚àÉ (there exists)
- **Domain of discourse**: The set of mathematical objects being reasoned about

**Mathematical Predicates**:
- Equal(x, y): x equals y
- GreaterThan(x, y): x is greater than y
- IsInteger(x): x is an integer
- Divides(x, y): x divides y evenly

#### Modal Logic for Mathematical Reasoning
SMART-CoT incorporates modal operators to reason about mathematical necessity and possibility:
- **‚ñ°P**: "It is necessarily true that P" (mathematical necessity)
- **‚óäP**: "It is possibly true that P" (mathematical possibility)
- **K_i P**: "Agent i knows that P" (mathematical knowledge)

### Proof Theory
